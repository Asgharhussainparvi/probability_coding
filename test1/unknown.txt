Evolution has shaped the diversity of species through natural selection over millions of years. Cellular processes convert nutrients into energy through complex biochemical pathways. Genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to proteins, with regulatory mechanisms controlling gene expression. Conservation efforts focus on maintaining biodiversity in ecosystems to ensure their long-term stability.
