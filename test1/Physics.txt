Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of matter at the atomic scale. The uncertainty principle and wave-particle duality challenge our understanding of reality. Recent experiments with quantum computers have demonstrated potential advantages over classical computing methods. Researchers continue to debate interpretations of quantum theory and its implications for our understanding of the physical world.
