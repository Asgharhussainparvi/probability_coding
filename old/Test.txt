The head of the country in a democratic government is the one who gets the most support in the form of votes in a general election. 	One individual is the sole authority of the country with no institution to keep its power in check
Political control in a country is provided through free and fair elections, with two or more political parties being involved.	In a dictatorship no elections take place or they are heavily regulated by restricting the number of political parties and limiting gatherings and associations
The media in a democratic form of government is known as the fourth pillar of democracy as they watch the government’s every move and criticise it should any misstep be taken.	The media is the mouthpiece of a dictatorial government. Regardless of what a dictator does, the media will only show what needs to be shown to the masses so that a cult of personality is always maintained.
In a democracy, the fundamental rights of the citizen are protected by the constitution. Citizens have the right to join political parties and other organizations.	In a dictatorship, little importance is given to fundamental rights, with the populace being generally subjected to constant policing, monitoring and brutality.
The earliest forms of democracy appeared in Ancient Greece. It is generally accepted that the Athenians established what is held as the first democracy in 508–507 BC. The democracy was rudimentary in the sense that only free-males of Athens could cast their votes but not women and slaves	Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix and Gaius Julius Ceaser of Ancient Rome can be considered as the first dictators.
